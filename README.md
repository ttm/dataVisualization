### content

* slides/atividade1.md
has slides for the first exposition on data mining.



### data sources

* THE University rankings:

* OECD Better Life Index:

* Data.World

* DBpedia

### ideas:

* Scrap THE (above) because I did not find how to export the data.

* Use audio found in the linux system and do some sort of analysis and classification.

* MIDI?

* Make some analysis of networks.
E.g. see if really there is little sobreposition between
top closeness and betweenness.

* Expose the analysis model with Shakespeare and the KJ Bible (exemplified for Joyce).

* Use synthesized data for validating the statistic derived from the KS test.

* Expose the analysis made in my PhD.

* Names of Nobel Prizes?

* Electrocardiogram? EEG?

* Explain a little bit about Vim, IPython, Gephi, Audacity.

* Use linked data and SparQL queries.
