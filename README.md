### content

* slides/atividade1.md

* figs/\*

* data/\*
are data files. 


### data sources

* THE University rankings:

### ideas:

* Scrap THE (above) because I did not find how to export the data.

* Use audio found in the linux system and do some sort of analysis and classification. (USED)

* MIDI?

* Make some analysis of networks.
E.g. see if really there is little sobreposition between
top closeness and betweenness. (USED)

* Expose the analysis model with Shakespeare and the KJ Bible (exemplified for Joyce).

* Use synthesized data for validating the statistic derived from the KS test.

* Expose the analysis in the thesis:
https://github.com/ttm/thesis/raw/master/thesis-rfabbri.pdf

* Names of Nobel Prizes? (USED)

* Electrocardiogram? EEG?

* Explain a little bit about Vim, IPython, Gephi, Audacity.

* Use linked data and SparQL queries. (USED a little bit)
